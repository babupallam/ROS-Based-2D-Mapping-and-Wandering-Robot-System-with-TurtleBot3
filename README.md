# ROS-Based 2D Mapping and Wandering Robot System with TurtleBot3
 This project demonstrates a robust 2D mapping and wandering robot system implemented using the TurtleBot3 platform and the Robot Operating System (ROS). The goal of the project is to enable the TurtleBot3 to autonomously explore and map an unknown environment in real-time, while dynamically visualizing the map in RViz.
